# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `Assets/` holds all game content (scenes, settings, input assets, textures) plus the `.meta` files Unity requires.
- `Assets/Scenes/` contains scene files (`*.unity`).
- `Assets/Settings/` stores project- and render-pipeline settings assets.
- `Packages/` contains `manifest.json` and `packages-lock.json` for Unity package dependencies.
- `ProjectSettings/` and `UserSettings/` capture Unity editor/project configuration.
- `Library/` and `Logs/` are generated by Unity; do not edit or commit their contents.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Open the project in Unity Hub using the editor version from `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` (currently `6000.3.5f2`).
- Run the game in the editor using Play mode.
- Build via **File → Build Settings…** and export to a local folder like `Builds/` (create as needed).
- There are no scripted build/test commands in this repo yet; use the Unity Editor UI.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- C# scripts should live under `Assets/` (create `Assets/Scripts/` if needed).
- Use standard Unity C# conventions: `PascalCase` for classes and public members, `camelCase` for locals and private fields.
- Match file names to class names (e.g., `PlayerController.cs`).
- Keep folder names in `PascalCase` (e.g., `Assets/Scenes/`, `Assets/Settings/`).

## Testing Guidelines
- The Unity Test Framework package is installed; use **Window → General → Test Runner**.
- If adding tests, place them in `Assets/Tests/EditMode/` or `Assets/Tests/PlayMode/`.
- No automated test suite is currently configured; document any manual test steps in your PR.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- This repo doesn’t include Git history (it uses Unity Plastic SCM metadata in `.plastic`), so no commit-message convention is enforced.
- For PRs: include a concise summary, testing notes (or “Not tested”), and screenshots/GIFs for visual changes.
- Link any relevant task or issue and note the Unity editor version used when it matters.

## Asset & Configuration Notes
- Always keep `.meta` files with their assets; moving or renaming assets should move the corresponding `.meta` file.
- Avoid editing `ProjectSettings/` unless the change is intentional and documented in the PR description.
